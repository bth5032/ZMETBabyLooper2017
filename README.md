# 2016METClosureTests
Closure Tests for the 2016 ZMET Analysis.

This repository contains the code to do the closure tests between the Z boson events and photon events with jets at the LHC for the 2016 ZMET analysis.

The babies are made with the [ZMET2016 code in the cmstas group](https://github.com/cmstas/ZMET2016).
